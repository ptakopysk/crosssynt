To use the "Slavic Forest, Norwegian Wood" cross-lingual parsing system,
you need to fulfill several prerequisities:

You need to have the following software:
- Bash
- Python 3
- Perl
- Treex
- UDPipe
- word2vec

You need to have the following data:
- UD treebank for the src language
    - train is sufficient
- UD treebank for the tgt language
    - dev/test for evaluation
    - either the train, or a trained tgt UDPipe tagger
    - if you want to evaluate the supervised upper bound, you need tgt train
