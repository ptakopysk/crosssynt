To use the "Slavic Forest, Norwegian Wood" cross-lingual parsing system,
you need to fulfill several prerequisities:

You need to have the following software:
- Bash
- Python 3
- Perl
- Treex (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex)
- UDPipe (bundled in tools/)
- word2vec (bundled in tools/)

You need to have the following data:
- UD treebank for the src language
    - train is sufficient
- UD treebank for the tgt language
    - dev for evaluation
    - train for training the tagger and the supervised upper bound
      (you may also provide a trained target tagger and ommit the supervised evaluation)
- parallel data (separate plaintext file for each of the languages, one
  sentence per line, with an implicit sentence-level alignment, i.e. sentences
  on the same line correspond to each other)
Small smaple data for Czech->Polish are provided,
with the identifiers cs_small and pl_small

The scripts to run reside in the run/ directory.
If you have an SGE cluster, use the the *.shc files,
otherwise use the *.sh files.

To run the pipeline on the sample data, go to the run/ directory and run:
    ./all-cs_small-pl_small.sh
Or, if you have an SGE cluster:
    qsub all-cs_small-pl_small.shc

To create your own setup, substitute the SSS and TTT placeholders in the
all-SSS-TTT.sh template with the languages to use
(and put the necessary data into the treebanks/ and para/ directories), e.g.:
    sed -e s/SSS/cs/ -e s/TTT/pl/ all-SSS-TTT.sh > all-cs-pl.sh

The source code of the template file is commented, modify it or remove parts
of it according to your needs.
