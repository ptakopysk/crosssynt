To use the "Slavic Forest, Norwegian Wood" cross-lingual parsing system,
you need to fulfill several prerequisities:

You need to have the following software:
- Bash
- Python 3
- Perl
- Treex (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex)
- UDPipe (bundled in tools/)
- word2vec (bundled in tools/)

You need to have the following data:
- UD treebank for the src language
    - train is sufficient
- UD treebank for the tgt language
    - dev for evaluation
    - train for training the tagger and the supervised upper bound
      (you may also provide a trained target tagger and ommit the supervised evaluation)
- parallel data (separate plaintext file for each of the languages, one
  sentence per line, with an implicit sentence-level alignment, i.e. sentences
  on the same line correspond to each other)
Small smaple data for Czech->Polish are provided (the language labels used are
"CS" and "PL" not to clash with actual data with "cs" and "pl" labels)
