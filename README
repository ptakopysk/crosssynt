To use the "Slavic Forest, Norwegian Wood" cross-lingual parsing system,
you need to fulfill several prerequisities:

You need to have the following software:
- Bash
- Python 3
- Perl
- Treex (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex)
- UDPipe (bundled in tools/)
- word2vec (bundled in tools/)

You need to have the following data:
- UD treebank for the src language
    - train is sufficient
- UD treebank for the tgt language
    - dev for evaluation
    - train for training the tagger and the supervised upper bound
      (you may also provide a trained target tagger and ommit the supervised evaluation)
- parallel data (separate plaintext file for each of the languages, one
  sentence per line, with an implicit sentence-level alignment, i.e. sentences
  on the same line correspond to each other)
Small smaple data for Czech->Polish are provided,
with the identifiers cs_small and pl_small

The scripts to run reside in the run/ directory.
If you have an SGE cluster, use the the *.shc files,
otherwise use the *.sh files.

To run the pipeline on the sample data, go to the run/ directory and run:
    ./all-cs_small-pl_small.sh
Or, if you have an SGE cluster:
    qsub all-cs_small-pl_small.shc

To create your own setup, go into the run/ directory and run e.g.:
    ./new.sh cs pl

The source code of the template file is commented, modify it or remove parts
of it according to your needs.

Of course, you need to make sure that you have the treebank and parallel data.
If you are lucky, you can get these automatically:
- for treebanks, simply go to the treebanks/ directory and run:
    ./get_UD-1.4_treebanks.sh
- for parallel data, go into the para/ directory and run e.g.:
    ./try_get_para_SRC_TGT.sh cs pl
